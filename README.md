This project looks into the relationship between a country's GDP per capita and water service accessibility in schools. Upon data cleaning and conjoining of global water access and World Bank GDP, log-scale scatterplot was graphed in order to observe trends. A high positive relationship between water infrastructure and economic development was achieved through analysis, with real outliers yielding evidence toward policy and development gaps.
